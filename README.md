> **Heads Up: HDF5 Drops Autotools March 10th**
>
> The day has arrived: the day we've all been dreading—or eagerly anticipating, depending on your perspective. Yes, we're switching to CMake-only builds in HDF5. Prepare yourselves.
>
> The [PR stripping all autotools](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/pull/5308) will go into the "develop" branch on **March 10, 2025**. HDF5 2.0, scheduled for release in Fall 2025, will *only* support the CMake build system.

>If you’d like to learn more about this decision, check out this blog post from November 2022: [Can we remove the autotools?](https://www.hdfgroup.org/2022/11/14/can-we-remove-the-autotools/) And the [HDF5 2.0 planning wiki](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/wiki/HDF5-2.0-Release-Planning). If you use autotools for your builds, now is a great time to update your workflows to CMake.

RELEASE SCHEDULE
----------------

![HDF5 release schedule][u2] 

HDF5 does not follow a regular release schedule. Instead, updates are based on the
introduction of new features and the resolution of bugs. However, we aim to have at
least one annual release for each maintenance branch. Please note that the future
HDF5 releases listed on this schedule are tentative.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In subsequent releases after 1.14, HDF5 will adopt [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
> Therefore, the upcoming major release will be designated as 2.0.0.

| Release | New Features |
| ------- | ------------ |
| 2.0.0 | Drop Autotools support, drop the HDF5 <--> GIF tools, add complex number support, update library defaults (cache sizes, etc.) |
| FUTURE | Multi-threaded HDF5, crashproofing / metadata journaling, Full (VFD) SWMR, encryption, digital signatures, sparse datasets, improved storage for variable-length datatypes, better Unicode support (especially on Windows) |

[A list of planned HDF5 2.0 features and bugfixes can be found here.](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/wiki/HDF5-2.0-Planning)

This list of feature release versions is tentative, and the release
in which a feature is introduced may change.
